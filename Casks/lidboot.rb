# Homebrew cask for LidBoot — published to h3x4d3x4/homebrew-tap by scripts/publish-tap.sh,
# which rewrites version and sha256 from the DMG GitHub is actually serving. Don't edit
# those two lines by hand: a checksum that disagrees with the file breaks `brew install`
# for everyone at once, and unlike a bad DMG there's no Sparkle to correct it.
#
#   brew tap h3x4d3x4/tap
#   brew trust --cask h3x4d3x4/tap/lidboot     # Homebrew 7 gates third-party casks
#   brew install --cask lidboot
#
# auto_updates: the app updates itself through Sparkle, so without this Homebrew would
# report it outdated forever and offer to reinstall over a copy that already updated.
